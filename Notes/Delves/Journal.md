# Back in the Saddle Again 

## State of The Delves
- There was a riot at Point Rao.
___
## Homewreckers
- We stabled our lizards at the edge of town for a nominal fee.

- In exchange for our services in [Bulok Pol](/bulok.md) and rescuing the remaining survivors of Thrumming, Lugo not only paid us HANDSOMELY - but also provided us with [a wonderful home](Segments/homebase.md) to use as a base while in Delve Mora

- Moza and Wren offered (or were coerced, sort of) into staying in the home and working as housekeepers, as well as maintaining the community garden (Moza is quite the druid, and grows a hellishly delicious tomato)

___

## But, what ARE we doing exactly?

- We had a little 'team meeting' in our new home, and decided on a new cover story for any questioning pals:

    - We're working with Clan Carnet as cartographers and mapping out new potential trade routs throughout the delves.
- Moza and Wren cooked us a delicious dinner, if a little bit too salty.

- And then Pteromi decided to try and tell everyone over dinner that we were charting out a river, happened to end up in Bulok Pol, and then managed to somehow forge the new trade contract. And they started getting carried away, and talking a little bit TOO in-depth about the sick god and our intervention. Their halting performance as they danced around the topic of angels was painful. I don't know if our friends now think we're totally insane, or if they're suspicious. Cool, and great.

- After all that fun, I needed a break - so I headed out to [OYSTER STORE] and had myself a nice wind down.

- I did make it home in time to make a blanket fort with Pteromi. It came out decently. If I'm honest with myself, it was really quite nice.

# Bustle and Hustle and Rustle

## Eka Takes a Peeka

- Eka went to the temple of ways to catch up with Cera. She met Callo, the amiably confused older "High Locator".

- There are some big changes happening further up in the hierarchy of the church?

- Eka and Cera took a journey into the Cacophony Market, ostensibly to run some errands together.

- Cera apparently read a missive on the desk of Callo (understandable, given that the high locator seems to have barely any screws left to leave loose). It spoke of the situation regarding the angel threat.

- The missive also spoke of some kind of a ritual, that the High Locators had been attempting to perform. They had begun moving magical objects from various locations in the church, making preparations to perform this ritual simultaneously in all of the Delves.

- High Locator Deya was sent to coordinate the ritual. Deya has sort of taken over the direction of things, not in a hostile way - but for the sake of having a more organized response to what is happening.

- Something flies through the air, slicing into the back of Cera's neck.

- A kobold woman briefly makes eye contact with Eka from across the crowd. In a totally normal way, like a nice normal innocent person might do.

- It quickly became apparent that Cera had been poisoned, as he began to fade and tire rapidly.

- Wasting absolutely no time, (and sparing no thought for the innocent shoppers around), Eka Dimension-Door'd herself and Cera over to the Kobold woman and politely asked what she had done.

- The woman answered, in an extremely normal and sane manner, by raising a sharp clawed pinky and licking a drop of blood from it, before also Dimension-Dooring away to somewhere unknowable.

- Eka healed the wound on the back of Cera's neck, but as it closed it formed an angry red scar, and tendrils of inflammation immediately began spreading from the scar.

> _"Are we in danger?" - Cera_
>
> _"Well, you're in danger." - Eka
>
> _"What? I can't be in danger - I was just shopping" - Cera_

- A memory began to surface in Eka's mind. A very old memory, lacking most of it's context, but clearly pertinent nonetheless:

> "If I'm to go through with this plan, I need to make sure that if I ever get close to this creature, under no circumstances can I allow it to scratch me"

- Though Eka could not remember specifically what the origin of this memory is, she is aware that it was prior to her transformation.

## Alepha Lot of Unfinished Business

- I went to visit Alepha early in the working day.

- They were out on their front step, completely covered in soot, and obviously having a short break from hard work.

- I brought them a set of nice graving tools, which they seemed appreciative of.

- I tried to explain the jumpiness I had been experiencing in my sword lately.

- While trying to explain myself in a way that wouldn't make me appear even more silly than I unfortunately am, Alepha asked if I had fought anything notable lately. A pointed, pointy question which I couldn't exactly avoid, but Alepha was kind enough to allow me to answer in vague terms.

- It was revealed to me that Marauve training me was a bit of an impulsive decision, and because of that I was not privvy to certain aspects of what it means to be in the order of Splendid Sharpness.
- Alepha suspects I have made contact with some kind of a patron? One of the founders - or something like that. Through my actions I gained the attention of an entity on some other plain.
- We sat down as they began to explain the history of the [Order of Splendid Sharpness](segments/Order%20of%20Splendid%20Sharpness.md).

- After consulting remotely with Lugo (via Sending), I decided to loop in Marauve and Alepha regarding the angel situation.

- My hope is that they can work at training up new members of the order to face the threat of angels in the future.

- The news was as well-recieved as expected. Alepha went into their house and retrieved a box of emerald ingots, which surprised me. Apparently the legendary sword "Crescendo" is best made from emerald - the resonant properties of the stone work better with our magic.

- Marauve said that we need to get the attention of Splendor. So we began to spar. Viciously. It was surprising to find myself matching her expertise, last time we fought I was thrown around the room. This is different. I began to feel the strange vibration again, excitement.

- Alepha set to moulding the Emerald into it's final form. The whole thing was like a bizarre dance of incredible skill and concentration: Marauve and I darting about clashing swords while Alepha sweat over the melting emerald.

> "Splendor does not want butchery, it wants the art of the violence."

- After a while, Alepha called out that it was time. Marauve and I locked eyes and bowed. I walked over to where Alepha was standing, and laid my hands upon the blade.

- Like water turning to ice in a mold, the emerald transformed from an unfinished, blank blade into a beautifully detailed and ornate weapon - until it suddenly stopped.

- A shining, emerald blade lay upon the anvil. Murkily transluscent straitions cascaded through the length of the blade.

___
## Urk Irks a Jerk

- Urk went to go see The Blind Maw.

- Urk has some really nice friends, it would seem.

- The Maw revealed to Urk that she has a pixie, Flinthollow, trapped in a bell jar. Flinthollow was an associate of Echomerry. Echomerry (described the The Maw as a 'poisonous little shit') was the pixie we had encountered on the periphery of Thrumming towards the end of its destruction.

- It appears that the Blind Maw knows a lot more than anyone should feel comfortable with. She is aware of what happened in Thrumming, she is aware that we fought off angels there.

- Maw knew about Unity. Claims to have considered her a friend! As though the Maw has friends. She wanted to know what ultimately happened.

- Wow, I am an idiot. Of course. The Blind Maw is the other daughter of Vhey.

- Maw wants Echomerry dead. Very dead.

        I won't rest until Echomerry is a stain on my floor

## Pteromi Has a Very Nice, Very Normal Day

- Pteromi had a very nice day, wandering down into The Fumes with Wren and Moza, doing some shopping.

- The day was perfectly nice, until they look up suddenly - and notice a group of Scavs standing clustered in the road ahead. One of them looked up and smiled at them, and called them by name.

- The chorus of voices in Pteromi's head warned them about these Scavs almost immediately.

- Everyone drew weapons super casually, like it was no big deal. The leader did say something particularly unnerving:

    >"You're not usually our type, but, y'know... orders"
    >
    > *-- A wererat, unkowningly on the brink of death.*

- Needless to say, a fight broke out. Pteromi, Wren, and Moza readied themselves.

- Another group started to form behind them as well. It appears this was some kind of a planned ambush. (Read: not great).

### Wererats? Where?! Rats!

_Pteromi narrows their eyes and a beam of moonlight crashes down from above, showering four of the rats in a watery glow. The rats hiss and cry out, attempting to move out of the searing light. Pteromi takes a swing at the leader as they run past, but misses._

_The rats flee from the pool of moonlight, many others readying their hand-crossbows and loosing bolts in Pteromi's direction. Three of the bolts find purchase. Several more rats rush in, swords flashing, nails scraping, mouths biting, as they gang up on Pteromi, tearing deep gashes and doing a significant amount of damage in a short time. More rats can be heard in the distance, moving in to join the fray._

_Wren takes a swing at one of the rats, but misses. The wererat seems to dismiss the attempt, paying no mind to Wren or Moza at all. Moza lays a supportive hand on Pteromi's back, casting cure wounds._

_Pteromi lashes out at the attackers, bringing their spear to bear against one of the were-rats repeatedly, viciously, finishing the assault by railing the butt of their spear through their throat._

_One is down, but the rest of the were-rats come in with a fervor. Swords, crossbow bolts, scratches, bites, kicks, coming from every direction. Too many of them, too fast, overwhelming force._

_The world is a blur of blood, claws, and blades flashing in every direction. Pteromi passes out, as they drop to the ground they lash out with Spite - beheading one of the were-rats - and then everything fades to black._

_Or does it?! Suddenly, a deep, gravelly voice -impossible to discern if real or imagined- echoes from above:_

>"_Stop! Little Cursebloods. This is not your prey. I AM"_

_And then a thud - a massive thud - as someone leaps from a rooftop and lands over Pteromi's body_

_A silver hammer flashes through the air, felling several were-rats where they stand._

_A were-rat is heard saying the name "grom" in fear._

_One of the were-rats brings a sword to bear against Wren's throat. Before the rat can act, the silver hammer sails through the air and smashes the were-rat's head against the stone wall. Wren slips out, unharmed._

_Moza runs over and lays his hands on Pteromi, and the world brightens up just enough._

>_"Holy shit, are you alright? What is HAPPENING?" - Moza_
>
>_"I think... we almost got mugged." - Pteromi_

_The massive Scav reaches down, and picks Pteromi up off of the ground. The Scav is enormous; festooned with weapons, adorned in silver-plated chainmail.

### Grom Who Saved The Idiot's Ass

- The enormous, frankly irresponsibly yoked Scav who saved Pteromi was none other than Grom who Broke The Giant's Back.

- Grom wanted to know why on earth the 'cursebloods' were interested in killing Pteromi.
