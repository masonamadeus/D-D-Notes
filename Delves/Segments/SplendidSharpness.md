# Order of Splendid Sharpness

### History of Splendid Sharpness

_There was a time when the Kobold kingdoms were in a state of flux. Sorcerer warlords were ruling with an iron fist, spending the lives of our people in a series of self destructive wars battling for supremacy. It was a bad time. It was a particularly unsettled period in our history._

_Legend has it there was a woman, a bard, who despaired of the situation. She dreampt of providing some sort of 'check' to the tyrannical reign of the warlords, but knew at the time that bards were barely tolerated and not regarded as being 'on par' with the power of the sorcerers. A sort of disparate group, not particularly trained in the combative arts._

_According to various sources, she had a revelation after contacting some kind of higher-powered entity. At the time, Kobold nations were located in and aroudn a network of precursor ruins - thoroughly scavenged and picked over at that point in history. They were thought to be haunted. There were signs of loose magic, making them unsafe and scary, and mostly inhospitable. This woman went into the wilderness, to a place called the Veridian Altar. Formerly a huge dome of seamless emerald, long ago shattered and sold off._

_In that place, she sat and listened. She didn't eat, she didn't sleep. She attuned all of her magical and mundane senses to a razors edge, tuning out every single sense to an extreme level. When she was almost at the point of collapse, she heard something. A note, a scream. Something primal, older than gods, older than the world._

_In clan Sadar, we take a more focused, pragmatic approach to our art. Not many of us dive into the deeper layers of 'why' what we do works. There are, of course, schools of thought that attempt to explain everything as being part of the primal song._

_There are aspects, or notes of this primal song that do indeed ring through us, in moments of particularly high emotion, action, or other significant moment. There are those that claim these notes are actually able to think, and act with agency. A kind of living song_

_There are those who think what this woman made contact with was one of these living songs. She made a pact, agreeing to bring this living song into the world, to spread it, propagate it, in exchange for might. The power to overthrow the warlords._

_She of course, was more forward thinking than that. She returned from the wilderness with an idea. An idea of a sword. The platonic ideal of what a sword should be._

_After months of attempts, toil, and failures, she was able to produce this sword. One that she could use to amplify her bardic abilities, one she could use to teach others her art. Her fighting style is that which influenced the entirety of the Order of Splendid Sharpness. Her technique is what is passed down amongst the order._

At this point in the story, Marauve arrived and informed me that the message Alepha had sent was as follows:

**"Help help help, it's happening again, get here right away. Help. It's Vaixhelm this time. Get here right now"**
___
_The warlords minions eventually slayed this woman, and destroyed her sword. Thinking they had ended the threat, a few days later - her finest student had an idea for a sword. The platonic ideal of a sword._

Marauve was the most recent member of the order to feel the call, and make a sword. She had believed that she was the final person in the line of the order.


## Recent History

Before I was a student in Clan Sadar, there were about a dozen members of the Order of Splendid Sharpness. Marauve had been on a mission to regrow the order. She had thought that perhaps the orders prupose had been fulfilled. There were no more warlords to slay, no tyrants to fight against. The order was no longer holding up its end of the bargain for the order.

The entity goes by many names, but Marauve has called it "Splendor".

The order had been reduced to mostly a social club for bards who liked swords. Without a common enemy to unite against, what else was there to do?

The previous grand master of the order had been a winged kobold, who went missing after the Exodus War with the angels.

Marauve had decided to try re-galvanizing the Order, by seeking out the former grand master, or what happened to him.

Marauve and her band of bards fought bandits, tracked down monsters, and generally did a lot of good in the world as they wandered towards where they thought the winged kobolds had ended up.

Their quest came to an end when they discovered the dragon. And what had happened to the rest of the tribe of winged kobolds.

They fought as best as they could, Marauve lost her arm, the rest lost their lives. Only her and Alepha made it out.

At this point in the story Marauve stopped abruptly, and explained:

    The sword doesn't change who you are, but it has a pull to it. It has an agenda. It IS a give and a take, and if you don't give: it will abandon you. Perhaps when you need it the most.
    
    You always have a choice, it never takes away your free will, but you will very much not want to say 'no'.
