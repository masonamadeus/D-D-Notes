# Back in the Saddle Again

## State of The Delves
- There has been an abundance of were-rat activity, though the scavs have not seemed keen to address this. Obviously. That's terrifying. We should speak with Vanya about this.

## Vaixhelm's Journey
- I need to speak with Alepha about what has been happening with me. Also it would be good to catch up.
