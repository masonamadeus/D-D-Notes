# Fighting Fair with the Fae Folk
___
## Echomurder
- After the climax of the battle, which involved a bloodied Echomerry holding Eka hostage at spearpoint while a hasty javelin launched from too-far-away by Pteromi sailed through the air to connect with his neck, we were returned to the court.
- Only the Fae in the spider dress applauded openly for us. Our friend the Baronet of Idle Stillness came to give his congratulations, and a parting gift of some kind of oily blob from his home. Or body. Home body?
- Apparently, part of Maw's pact with they Fey court involved a familiar. A role that Echomerry might as well have been born to play. I guess. I dunno, fuck that guy
- Maw took Echomerry, court dispersed. The princess was the last to leave, giving a parting bow to The Maw. The room returned to normal as the offerings disintegrated.
- Modo poured us drinks as The Maw left, Echomerry in tow like the worlds shittiest balloon.
- Apparently Modo had been in the Fae pit before, fighting the Marquis (that loudmouthed dingus that opposed us vehemently in the non-violent part of the court proceedings).
- Urk did not want to tell us this at the outset, but as it happens - we were battling not just for custody of Echomerry, but also for the bardic stylus - which would enable us to cut our travel time in half! We can essentially set up a circle in our home, and then connect it to a circle wherever we travel to.
- The glob of goo gifted to us by the Baronet was actually some kind of small sentient being, that is able to be turned into a nasty cloud of poisonous gas.
