# Don't Go Home

We remained separated, each dealing with our own personal issues.

## Urk Has Complicated Obligations

*Urk's meeting with the Blind Maw was about as cordial as those 'cherry cordial' candies that come about every holiday season. That is to say: not very, if at all.*

- It turns out that Echomerry was not always a pixie, and was once a more prominent/potent entity amongst the Fae. Maw claims to have known him then, and struck a deal with him.

- The details of Maw's deal are not entirely clear, but she claims that the terms she put him under ought to have prevented what happened in Thrumming. However, Echomerry is arguing that because of his loss of station - the bargain was nullified.

- For all her... idiosyncracies, Maw is incredibly knowledgeable about the Fae and their ways. She revealed that the Fae don't actually have any kind of 'supernatural' method of enforcing their deals and bargains, but rather a more mundane system of social pressures and class disparity.

## Vaixhelm Swings for the Fences

- Well, there it is. I'm staring at the sword that represents so much, but also so little. It feels like a turning point, but we're already well past that aren't we? Nothing is going to stop the angels if we walk away now.

- Someday, when we have defeated the angels and are able to go home, I just hope I have enough of my head left on my shoulders to put this sword away for good and retire.

- Marauve and I sparred after Alepha turned in for the evening. It was possibly the wildest sparring experience I have ever had... The sword truly does have a power all it's own. I lost the match, but Marauve looked happy.

- I really am going to need some practice with this, it has unlocked a whole slew of strange and new ways to conjure and control powerful vibrations.

- We really ripped up Alepha's lawn, I feel bad for them...

## Eka Freaks Out The Public

- Cera is poisoned, the culprit has vanished. Eka is in the market attracting considerable attention.

- Suddenly, Eka became aware of the crowd forming. To a casual observer, this must look very suspicious indeed.

- Some burly do-gooders approached, demanding to know what Eka is up to and why she might have teleported across the market and vanished a kobold woman.

- Eka's immediate apology defused the situation, and Cera backing up her story certainly helped. The do-gooders departed, awkwardly.

- No closer to discovering the identity of the culprit, Eka revealed to Cera that he was scratched by something Infernal. Cera took the pretty well, all things considered.

- Taking Cera to a clinic in the Temple of Ways, the pair were initially met with cynicism, but when the clinician's typical healing attempts failed - they were brought deeper into an exam room.

> *"What? I mean it's not... **not** infernal... What did this?"*
>
> *-- Locator Dyra*

- As they sat and waited for some help, a slurry of medical personnel cycled through the room - each repeating the same story: 'oh it's nothing', 'wait what', 'uh-oh, get a specialist'.

- Locator Dyra grilled Eka on why exactly a demonic entity was loose in the Delves and harming people. This is a natural thing to be concerned with, after all.

- Suddenly, Cera sat bolt upright in the bed, screaming horrifyingly at the top of his lungs and bleeding from his eyes.

- Cera claims that as soon as he began to drift to sleep, he saw hell. Actual real hell in front of his eyes.

- Dyra's advice was to keep Cera awake.

- Eka dug deep into her memories and knowledge of arcana, and figured out what has happened. Cera has been cursed, and is unable to sleep for any length of time. On the one hand, this is a good revelation because it means there is time to figure out what to do. On the other hand, Cera most certainly will die unless this is reversed.

- The creature hunting Eka is quite uniquely positioned for hunting spellcasters. Depriving a caster of their rest means they cannot recover spell slots. Not to mention, yknow, the death thing that happens when not sleeping for a while.

- Eka is many things. A reassuring presence is not one of those things. She very matter-of-factly described Cera's predicament to him and he did not seem to like that very much.

- Callow and Daya arrived. 

> *"THAT'S A CURSE. YE- YOU DI- THE BLOOD TEARS? YOU DIDN'T SEE THE-? ITS A CURSE. TEARS OF BLOOD? HOW DID YOU BECOME A HIGH LOCATOR WITHOUT SEEING A CURSE BEFORE? IS THIS MY ROOM? I'M SLEEPY."*
> 
> *--Callow*

- Callow may be old and slightly low on marbles, but he was one of the most renowned physicians in the delves. Hopefully he will be able to remove the curse, although not today because he is tired and it involves a lot of praying (which I can only infer must be exhausting).

- And then, Eka decided to enlist the help of Gaz-Gaz the demon bunny. She placed Gaz-Gaz on Cera's chest and instructed the bunny to keep Cera from sleeping. As though things weren't bad enough for the poor guy.
