# Don't Go Home

We remained separated, each dealing with our own personal issues.

## Urk Has Complicated Obligations

*Urk's meeting with the Blind Maw was about as cordial as those 'cherry cordial' candies that come about every holiday season. That is to say: not very, if at all.*

- It turns out that Echomerry was not always a pixie, and was once a more prominent/potent entity amongst the Fae. Maw claims to have known him then, and struck a deal with him.

- The details of Maw's deal are not entirely clear, but she claims that the terms she put him under ought to have prevented what happened in Thrumming. However, Echomerry is arguing that because of his loss of station - the bargain was nullified.

- For all her... idiosyncracies, Maw is incredibly knowledgeable about the Fae and their ways.

- She revealed that the Fae don't actually have any kind of 'supernatural' method of enforcing their deals and bargains, but rather a more mundane system of social pressures and class disparity.

- Maw claims to have a certain amount of favor, and a certain amount of sway, amongst the Fae court. She says she has been dealing with the Princess-In-Exile Marian for a long, long time.

> *"It is imperative for the longevity of this place that I am not fucked with."*
>
> *-- The Blind Maw*

- Maw says she is willing and able to summon the entire Fae court, and that they know she would show them a good time. With Echomerry's betrayal and the drama surrounding that, they would likely be eager to entertain a meeting.

- Apparently, Modo fought one of they Fey in the ring?? The fight was arranged due to a grievance that Maw had.

- Now, Maw is offering to summon the court - and this could end very badly for both her and us. It seems likely that we will be... fighting? A bunch of these Pixies? To the death? SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY

- Apparently, if we go through with this, Maw has promised we can keep the 'item'.

## Vaixhelm Swings for the Fences

- Well, there it is. I'm staring at the sword that represents so much, but also so little. It feels like a turning point, but we're already well past that aren't we? Nothing is going to stop the angels if we walk away now.

- Someday, when we have defeated the angels and are able to go home, I just hope I have enough of my head left on my shoulders to put this sword away for good and retire.

- Marauve and I sparred after Alepha turned in for the evening. It was possibly the wildest sparring experience I have ever had... The sword truly does have a power all it's own. I lost the match, but Marauve looked happy.

- I really am going to need some practice with this, it has unlocked a whole slew of strange and new ways to conjure and control powerful vibrations.

- We really ripped up Alepha's lawn, I feel bad for them...

## Eka The Good Doctor

- Cera is poisoned, the culprit has vanished. Eka is in the market attracting considerable attention.

- Suddenly, Eka became aware of the crowd forming. To a casual observer, this must look very suspicious indeed.

- Some burly do-gooders approached, demanding to know what Eka is up to and why she might have teleported across the market and vanished a kobold woman.

- Eka's immediate apology defused the situation, and Cera backing up her story certainly helped. The do-gooders departed, awkwardly.

- No closer to discovering the identity of the culprit, Eka revealed to Cera that he was scratched by something Infernal. Cera took the pretty well, all things considered.

- Taking Cera to a clinic in the Temple of Ways, the pair were initially met with cynicism, but when the clinician's typical healing attempts failed - they were brought deeper into an exam room.

> *"What? I mean it's not... **not** infernal... What did this?"*
>
> *-- Locator Dyra*

- As they sat and waited for some help, a slurry of medical personnel cycled through the room - each repeating the same story: 'oh it's nothing', 'wait what', 'uh-oh, get a specialist'.

- Locator Dyra grilled Eka on why exactly a demonic entity was loose in the Delves and harming people. This is a natural thing to be concerned with, after all.

- Suddenly, Cera sat bolt upright in the bed, screaming horrifyingly at the top of his lungs and bleeding from his eyes.

- Cera claims that as soon as he began to drift to sleep, he saw hell. Actual real hell in front of his eyes.

- Dyra's advice was to keep Cera awake.

- Eka dug deep into her memories and knowledge of arcana, and figured out what has happened. Cera has been cursed, and is unable to sleep for any length of time. On the one hand, this is a good revelation because it means there is time to figure out what to do. On the other hand, Cera most certainly will die unless this is reversed.

- The creature hunting Eka is quite uniquely positioned for hunting spellcasters. Depriving a caster of their rest means they cannot recover spell slots. Not to mention, yknow, the death thing that happens when not sleeping for a while.

- Eka is many things. A reassuring presence is not one of those things. She very matter-of-factly described Cera's predicament to him and he did not seem to like that very much.

- Callow and Daya arrived. 

> *"THAT'S A CURSE. YE- YOU DI- THE BLOOD TEARS? YOU DIDN'T SEE THE-? ITS A CURSE. TEARS OF BLOOD? HOW DID YOU BECOME A HIGH LOCATOR WITHOUT SEEING A CURSE BEFORE? IS THIS MY ROOM? I'M SLEEPY."*
> 
> *--Callow*

- Callow may be old and slightly low on marbles, but he was one of the most renowned physicians in the delves. Hopefully he will be able to remove the curse, although not today because he is tired and it involves a lot of praying (which I can only infer must be exhausting).

- And then, Eka decided to enlist the help of Gaz-Gaz the demon bunny. She placed Gaz-Gaz on Cera's chest and instructed the bunny to keep Cera from sleeping. As though things weren't bad enough for the poor guy.

- Daya took Eka into another room for a chat. Zone of Truth was cast. The interrogation began.

- Daya asked who the assailant was and why they were here. Eka responded that it is a demonic entity - a Rakshasa - which seems to be targeting the people close to Eka. He asked if Eka was aware that she was being pursued before she joined the priesthood. She was not.

> The goblin leans against the wall, letting his 'official' appearance sag slightly.

- Eka's demeanor seems off-putting to this goblin. He asks why a person with as much prowess in spellcasting as Eka would be so passive in terms of finding a solution to this problem.

- A Rakshasa is the perfect predator for a wizard. Eka remembers that even when she was a powerful arch-mage in her previous life, she regarded them with an extreme amount of caution.

- Eka revealed a lot of her past to Daya. Informing him that she used to be inconceivably more powerful than she is now.

- Understandably, he was unsure what to do with this information.

- Daya's demeanor took a change for the weird. My hunch is that he is quite unhappy about how much power Lugo is exerting on the temple? He glared at Eka with the same malice with which he regarded Havel, Lugo's Bodyguard.

- Then, things took an even worse/weirder turn. Daya attempted to cast a spell to locate the Rakshasa... and the spell failed in upon itself. Not as though it was improperly cast, not as though it's target was under a non-detection spell, but as though the spell was countered immediately. However this would need to be performed by... someone in the room?

- Something is up. Something very magical, and very dangerous, and very determined not to be detected. Something that must be dealt with.

- After cooling off alone in the storage closet, only startling a handful of acolytes, Eka set out from the Temple - stopping briefly to wish Cera well - before heading to the Coven of Smoke to talk with Zebrin.

- Eka really put the screws to Zebrin - or, really, Zebrin's own neuroses put the screws to himself - in order to acquire a spell scroll for Mordekainen's Private Sanctum. For free.

- Zebrin generously offered to acquire the scroll for Eka in a few days, when he would have time to nip into the storeroom and snag it before anyone noticed. But no, Eka needs it now.

- Zebrin agreed to get her a lesser scroll for *nondetection* instead, and she accepted.

- Then she proceeded to meet with Kalavan, and attempt to also weasel the Private Sanctum scroll out of *him*.

## Pteromi the Reverse Mind Reader

- Grom set off down the passageway.

- Pteromi called him 'Gorm' a lot, and then Grom eventually turned around.

- Pteromi asked Grom if he knew Olga. Grom said he knew the legend of Olga.

- The group set off, Moza and Wren tagging behind. They traveled up a series of elevators, rising away from the [Fumes](../Places/Delve-Mora.md#the-fumes) and ending up in a primarily Scav neighborhood in the [Scrape](../Places/Delve-Mora.md#the-scrape).

- Grom seems to attract attention wherever he goes. Not only is he naturally a large and powerful fellow, but being a Scav Curseblood Slayer is a pretty big deal.

- There's a social contract that a Slayer has the right to test you for lycanthropy at any point if they so choose. An unpleasant prospect, as it involves stabbing a silver needle into your arm (which would force a lycanthrope to immediately shapeshift).

- Everywhere Grom goes, he's met with a mixed reaction of apprehension at the possibility of being tested, and admiration/respect for his position. At this point, Grom hardly pays notice to this.

- As they entered the restaurant, Grom cleared a table (like a dick) by telling the previous tenants 'you look like you're done'. The group sat down, and Grom got to business immediately.

- Grom wants to know why the Cursebloods are after Pteromi. They responded by saying that they were familiar with Olga.

- Grom repeated the question, and Pteromi said "I don't know, but I know I get to talk to people like Olga".

> *"Ah, so micro-aggressions run in the family"*
>
> *--Tal, OOC*

- Pteromi continued to deftly avoid the question with all the grace of a pig on ice.

- Olga intervened, instructing Pteromi to repeat her words verbatim for what would essentially be the rest of the conversation.

- She referred to some event as being known as "The Night of Slayers' Shame" and mentioned that Pteromi was her successor. Ending with "I hope you'll come to trust them as I have."

- Grom was stunned, but intent. After a moment of consideration, he accepted Olga's explanation.

- However, the question of *why* the cursebloods are so interested in Pteromi remains. Grom theorized that perhaps they had caught wind of the fact Pteromi carried the memory of Olga.

- It is unusual for cursebloods to attempt to take the lives of non-Scavs. The fact that they are attacking Pteromi is of grave concern.

- The cursebloods do have a hierarchy of sorts, but typically operate in autonomous cells - as a way to avoid detection. It is possible that some kind of curseblood warlord has risen to power, and wants to see Pteromi terminated. This is somewhat unlikely, and the potential motivation remains murky.

# Let's All Make Our Problems Each Others' Problems Too

## Bringing the Threads Together

- I attempted to make some fungal-scones with prestidigitation which went about as well as one might expect. Then the lovely Nemora caught me carrying the tray of hellscones and allowed me to use her oven, and helped me to make some passable scungles.

- Slowly everyone filtered home and shared stories about what had been happening to them.

> *"No, the attack is tomorrow"*
> 
> *-- Urk, calmly*
