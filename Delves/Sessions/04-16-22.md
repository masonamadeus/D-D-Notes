# What's your favorite bird

## Let's Get Ready to Rumble

- Urk informed us that she had enrolled us in a prize fight against the Fae. Which is excellent.

- Apparently it's more than just a fight. We're expected to bring what is essentially a court case to the fight. And we have to make it entertaining enough to please the fae court. So, legal arguments, physical endangerment, and showmanship. 

> *"Ah, so a fight crafted primarily for the audience? I was part of a small troupe once, the WWE"* - Vaixhelm
> 
> *"What does that stand for?"* - Elias
>
> *"We Will, Everytime."* - Vaixhelm

- I did my best to work with Urk and Eka to create an inspiring (if a bit vague and vapid) opening monologue for the 'court proceedings' tomorrow.
- We spent the night in a magical hut of Eka's creation, as Eka reminded us that we are all *also* currently being hunted by the Rakshasa.
- If we don't all die in the very near future I am going to be extremely surprised. It would have been very nice to have a week off.

## Into The Maw
- We entered the Blind Maw, a tiered combination between a casino and a bloodpit. It was closed, presumably for us to engage in our very important 'Fae Cage Fight' (as Pteromi so elegantly put it)
- Some preparations seemed to have been made. Many stone basins had been set around the room in various random-seeming locations. Each basin contained strange things. One had an eel, one had a blood-stained shirt with a knife in it, you know - occulty things.
- As all the fae arrived, we struck the coolest possible pose. Rimlit from every direction, we looked absolutely badass.
- A new friend joined our party. The Baronet of Idle Stillness. Pulling themselves up from a pile of living muck. They seem chill, and claim their friends haven't arrived yet. I'd say they were odd, but by Fae standards this one seems pretty chill. At the very least it will be good to have someone well-versed in court proceedings around, who is willing to talk to us.
- The princess is not given to flattery
- The court experience was difficult. Eventually Urk struck an inroad by suggesting that Echomerry's re-entry to the court would set a precedent for further expansion, as more and more lesser Fae would attempt the same flavor of genocidal gambit that he did.
